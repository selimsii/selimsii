## 🧠 About Me

I'm Selim Can ÖVÜR — an embedded systems and AI-focused mechatronics engineer with hands-on experience in building real-world, production-level IoT systems. I focus on end-to-end solutions, from low-level device control to backend integration and AI system optimization.

### ⚡ **Key Strengths**:
- Real-time communication protocols (UDP, HTTP)
- Secure device communication with encryption and certificate-based authentication (mbedTLS, AES256, TLS)
- Memory optimization and partitioning for low-cost embedded devices
- OTA (over-the-air) update mechanisms and device versioning
- Backend integration using Flask APIs and custom queuing/database systems
- AI integration with TTS, STT, LLM fine-tuning, CUDA, and G-Cloud services
- Scalability Solutions For Real-Time Database-Transactions (RabbitMQ, Reddis Cache Microservice Applications)

### ⚡ **Electronics & PCB Design Experience**:
I have hands-on experience in PCB design and electronics prototyping, covering the complete development cycle from schematic design to board manufacturing and debugging.

🛠 - Schematic & PCB Design: Skilled in KiCad, capable of designing PCBs with both analog and digital components.

🧰 - Hardware Debugging: Skilled in using oscilloscopes, logic analyzers, and multimeters for signal tracing and fault isolation.

🔌 - Power & Signal Integrity: Designed custom power regulation circuits, including buck/boost converters and filtering stages.

🔧 - Prototyping & Assembly: Experienced with SMD soldering, PCB rework, and rapid prototyping for embedded products.

🖨️ - Fabrication Ready Designs: Delivered production-ready Gerber files and BOMs for board manufacturing services.

📐 - Sensor Integration: Integrated various analog/digital sensors (load cells, EMG electrodes, IMUs, temperature sensors) into embedded systems.

These experiences support my ability to deliver complete embedded solutions from hardware design to fully functioning firmware.

## 💼 Work Experience

### 🔸 AI R&D | Product Development (Jul 2025 – Present)
- Working on LLM fine-tuning, speech-to-text (STT), dataset optimization
- Experience with Google Cloud, Transformer architectures, CUDA workers, and Python packaging systems

### 🔸 Embedded Systems & IoT Engineer (Aug 2023 – Jul 2025)
- Led a team in a full-featured AI-integrated IoT product
- Developed custom encrypted UDP communication using mbedTLS and AES256
- Implemented HTTP mutual TLS authentication with device-side certificates
- Reduced processing cost with memory-efficient approaches (buffering, streaming, encryption)
- Designed OTA and firmware version control systems for remote embedded devices
- Built backend mechanisms: message queues, databases, API gateways
- Integrated reverse proxy services like Nginx for secure routing
- Worked directly with hardware for testing, certification (EMC, EMI, safety), and debugging

## 🚀 Selected Projects

- **TM1650 Display Driver**: A custom driver written in C++ to control multiple TM1650-based 4-digit 7-segment display modules using a shared clock line  

- **Embedded Firmware**:  
  Developed the complete firmware stack for an IoT-based smart toy, designed for children. The system included:
  - Audio playback over I2S using real time processed sound files
  - OTA updates, version control, and certificate-based device authentication
  - Dynamic memory management and low-level encryption (AES, TLS)
  - HTTP and UDP-based cloud communication
  - Partition Scheme and Embedded File System Management
  - Safety-critical firmware handling and robust fail-safes  
  - Worked closely on sound engineering aspects including codec integration and timing-sensitive playback using limited resources.
  - Captured 24-bit stereo audio from microphone over I2S, performed signal processing and format conversion (downsample to 16-bit mono) on the ESP32.  
  - Sent optimized audio streams to a server which then sent to cloud-based speech recognition API.  
  - This required custom buffer management, lightweight DSP techniques, and low-latency transport to enable efficient voice command recognition in an embedded environment.

- **Software Development**:
- Developed a javascript based IOT server API, handled communication over HTTP and UDP, managed device authentication and mutual certification.

- **Databases**:
- MySQL

- **HX711 Multi-Sensor Calibration Tool**:  
  Python tool to calibrate up to 10 load cells, store calibration data in JSON format, and send it to a backend server via POST requests.
